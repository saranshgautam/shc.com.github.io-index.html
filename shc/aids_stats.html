	<h1>HIV statictics</h1>
	<p>
		Here are today's HIV numbers:<br>
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>In 2016, about <a href="http://www.amfar.org/worldwide-aids-stats/">36.7 million</a> people worldwide were living with HIV. Of those, 2.1 million were children below the age of 15.</li>
		<li>In 2017, only <a href="http://www.amfar.org/worldwide-aids-stats/">20.9 million</a> people living with HIV were using antiretroviral therapy.</li>
		<li>Since the pandemic began, <a href="http://www.amfar.org/worldwide-aids-stats/">76.1 million</a> people have contracted HIV, and AIDS-related complications have claimed 35 million lives.</li>
		<li>In 2016, <a href="http://www.amfar.org/worldwide-aids-stats/">1 million</a> people died from AIDS-related diseases. This is a decline from 1.9 million in 2005.</li>
		<li>Eastern and southern Africa are hardest hit. In 2016, <a href="http://www.amfar.org/worldwide-aids-stats/">19.4 million</a> people in these areas were living with HIV, and 790,000 more contracted the virus. The region has more than half of all people living with HIV worldwide.</li>
		<li>Every 9.5 minutes, someone in the United States contracts the virus. That’s more than <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/opa/reproductive-health/sexually-transmitted-infections/hiv/index.html">56,000</a> new cases a year. It’s estimated that 1.1 million Americans are currently living with HIV, and 1 in 5 don’t know that they have it.</li>
		<li>About <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/opa/reproductive-health/fact-sheets/sexually-transmitted-diseases/hiv/index.html">180,000</a> American women are living with HIV. In the United States, almost half of all new cases occur in African-Americans.</li>
		<li>Untreated, a woman with HIV has a <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/opa/reproductive-health/sexually-transmitted-infections/hiv/index.html">25 percent</a> chance of passing HIV to her baby during pregnancy or breastfeeding. With antiretroviral therapy throughout pregnancy and avoidance of breastfeeding, the risk is less than <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/opa/reproductive-health/sexually-transmitted-infections/hiv/index.html">2 percent</a>.</li>
		<li>In the 1990s, a 20-year-old person with HIV had a <a href="http://www.aidsmap.com/Life-expectancy-in-HIV-positive-people-in-the-US-still-lags-13-years-behind-HIV-negative-people/page/3040314/">life expectancy</a> of 19 years. By 2011, it had improved to 53 years. Today, life expectancy is <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanhiv/article/PIIS2352-3018%2817%2930066-8/fulltext?elsca1=tlpr">near normal</a> if antiretroviral therapy is started soon after contracting HIV.</li>
	</ul><br>
	<p>
		As access to antiretroviral therapy continues to improve around the world, these statistics will hopefully keep changing. <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/hiv-aids/facts-statistics-infographic">Learn more statistics about HIV</a>.
