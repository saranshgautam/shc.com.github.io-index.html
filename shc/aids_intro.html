	<h1>What is HIV?</h1>
	<p>
		HIV is a virus that damages the immune system. The immune system helps the body fight off infections. Untreated HIV infects and kills CD4 cells, which are a type of immune cell called T cells. Over time, as HIV kills more CD4 cells, the body is more likely to get various types of infections and cancers.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		HIV is transmitted through bodily fluids that include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>blood</li>
			<li>semen</li>
			<li>vaginal and rectal fluids</li>
			<li>breast milk</li>
		</ul>
	<p>The virus doesn’t spread in air or water, or through casual contact.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		HIV is a lifelong condition and currently there is no cure, although many scientists are working to find one. However, with medical care, including treatment called <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/hiv-aids/understanding-the-aids-cocktail">antiretroviral therapy</a>, it’s possible to manage HIV and live with the virus for many years.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		Without treatment, a person with HIV is likely to develop a serious condition called AIDS. At that point, the immune system is too weak to fight off other diseases and infections. Untreated, life expectancy with AIDS is about <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/basics/whatishiv.html">three years</a>. With antiretroviral therapy, HIV can be well-controlled and life expectancy can be nearly the same as someone who has not contracted HIV.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		It’s estimated that <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/opa/reproductive-health/sexually-transmitted-infections/hiv/index.html">1.1 million</a> Americans are currently living with HIV. Of those people, 1 in 5 don’t know they have the virus.<br>

	<h1>What is AIDS?</h1>
	<p>
		AIDS is a disease that can develop in people with HIV. It’s the most advanced stage of HIV. But just because a person has HIV doesn’t mean they’ll develop AIDS.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		HIV kills CD4 cells. Healthy adults generally have a <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/hiv-aids/cd4-viral-count">CD4 count</a> of <a href="https://www.hiv.va.gov/patient/diagnosis/labs-CD4-count.asp">500 to 1,500</a> per cubic millimeter. A person with HIV whose CD4 count falls below <a href="https://www.hiv.va.gov/patient/diagnosis/labs-CD4-count.asp">200</a> per cubic millimeter will be diagnosed with AIDS.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		A person can also be diagnosed with AIDS if they have HIV and develop an <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/hiv-aids/opportunistic-infections">opportunistic infection</a> or cancer that’s rare in people who don’t have HIV. An opportunistic infection, such as pneumonia, is one that takes advantage of a unique situation, such as HIV.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		Untreated, HIV can progress to AIDS within a decade. There’s no cure for AIDS, and without treatment, life expectancy after diagnosis is about <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/basics/whatishiv.html">three years</a>. This may be shorter if the person develops a severe opportunistic illness. However, treatment with antiretroviral drugs can prevent AIDS from developing.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		If AIDS does develop, it means that the immune system is severely compromised. It’s weakened to the point where it can no longer fight off most diseases and infections. That makes the person vulnerable to a wide range of illnesses, including:
	</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/pneumonia">pneumonia</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/thrush">oral thrush</a>, a fungal infection in mouth or throat</li>
			<li>cytomegalovirys (CMV), a type of herper virus</li>
			<li><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/meningitis-cryptococcal">cryptococcal meningitis</a>, a fungal infection in the brain</li>
			<li><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/toxoplasmosis">toxoplasmosis</a>, a brain infection caused by a parasite</li>
			<li><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/cryptosporidiosis">cryptospordiosis</a>, an infection caused by intestinal parasite</li>
			<li>cancer, including <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/kaposis-sarcoma">Kaposi's sarcoma (KS)</a> and <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/lymphoma">lymphoma</a></li>
		</ul>
	<p>
		The shortened life expectancy linked with untreated AIDS isn’t a direct result of the syndrome itself. Rather, it’s a result of the diseases and complications that arise from having an immune system weakened by AIDS. <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/hiv-aids/most-dangerous-complications-of-hiv">Learn more about possible complications that can arise from HIV and AIDS</a>.
