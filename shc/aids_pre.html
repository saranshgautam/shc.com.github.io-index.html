	<h1>HIV prevention</h1>
	<p>
		Although many researchers are working to develop one, there’s currently no vaccine available to prevent the transmission of HIV. However, taking certain steps can help prevent the spread of HIV.<br>
	</p>
	<h2>Safer sex</h2>
	<p>The most common way for HIV to spread is through anal or vaginal sex without a condom. This risk can’t be completely eliminated unless sex is avoided entirely, but the risk can be lowered considerably by taking a few precautions. A person concerned about their risk of HIV should:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Get tested for HIV.</b> It’s important they learn their status and that of their partner.</li>
		<li><b>Get tested for other sexually transmitted infections (STIs).</b> If they test positive for one, they should get it treated, because having an STI increases the risk of contracting HIV.</li>
		<li><b>Use condoms.</b> They should learn the correct way to use condoms and use them every time they have sex, whether it’s through vaginal or anal intercourse. It’s important to keep in mind that pre-seminal fluids (which come out before male ejaculation) can contain HIV.</li>
		<li><b>Limit their sexual partners.</b> They should have one sexual partner with whom they have an exclusive sexual relationship.</li>
		<li><b>Take their medications as directed if they have HIV.</b> This lowers the risk of transmitting the virus to their sexual partner.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Other prevention meathods</h2>
	<p>
		Other steps to help prevent the spread of HIV include:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Avoid sharing needles or other drug paraphernalia.</b> HIV is transmitted through blood and can be contracted by using contaminated materials.</li>
		<li><b>Consider PEP.</b> A person who has been exposed to HIV should contact their healthcare provider about obtaining post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). PEP can reduce the risk of contracting HIV. It consists of three antiretroviral medications given for 28 days. PEP should be started as soon as possible after exposure, but before 36 to 72 hours have passed.</li>
		<li><b>Consider PrEP.</b> A person at a high risk of HIV should talk to their healthcare provider about <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/325820">pre-exposure prophylaxis</a> (PrEP). If taken consistently, it can lower the risk of contracting HIV. PrEP is a combination of two drugs available in pill form.</li>
	</ul><br>
