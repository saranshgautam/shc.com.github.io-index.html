	<h1>Common Cold Virus Came From Birds About 200 Years Ago, Study Suggests</h1>
	<p>
		A virus that causes cold-like symptoms in humans originated in birds and may have crossed the species barrier around 200 years ago, according to a new article published in the Journal of General Virology. Scientists hope their findings will help us understand how potentially deadly viruses emerge in humans.<br>

	<h1>History</h1>
	<p>
		While the cause of the common cold has only been identified since the 1950s, the disease has been with humanity throughout history. Its symptoms and treatment are described in the Egyptian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebers_papyrus">Ebers papyrus</a>, the oldest existing medical text, written before the 16th century BCE. The name "cold" came into use in the 16th century, due to the similarity between its symptoms and those of exposure to cold weather.<br>

		In the United Kingdom, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Cold_Unit">Common Cold Unit</a> was set up by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_Research_Council_(UK)">Medical Research Council</a> in 1946 and it was where the rhinovirus was discovered in 1956. In the 1970s, the CCU demonstrated that treatment with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon">interferon</a> during the incubation phase of rhinovirus infection protects somewhat against the disease, but no practical treatment could be developed. The unit was closed in 1989, two years after it completed research of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc_gluconate#Zinc_and_the_common_cold">zinc gluconate lozenges</a> in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis">prophylaxis</a> and treatment of rhinovirus colds, the only successful treatment in the history of the unit.
