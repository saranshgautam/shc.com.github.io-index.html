	<h1>Overview of Common Cold</h1>
	<p>
		The common cold is a viral infection of your nose and throat (upper respiratory tract). It's usually harmless, although it might not feel that way. Many types of viruses can cause a common cold.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		Children younger than 6 are at greatest risk of colds, but healthy adults can also expect to have two or three colds annually.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		Most people recover from a common cold in a week or 10 days. Symptoms might last longer in people who smoke. If symptoms don't improve, see your doctor.<br>
	</p>
	<h1>What’s the difference between a cold and the flu?</h1>
	<p>
		The common cold and the flu may seem very similar at first. They are indeed both respiratory illnesses and can cause similar symptoms. However, different viruses cause these two conditions, and your symptoms will gradually help you differentiate between the two.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		Both a cold and the flu share a few common symptoms. People with either illness often experience:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>a runny or stuffy nose</li>
		<li>sneezing</li>
		<li>body aches</li>
		<li>general fatigue.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		As a rule, flu symptoms are more severe than cold symptoms.
	</p>
	<p>
		Another distinct difference between the two is how serious they are. Colds rarely cause additional health conditions or problems. The flu, however, can lead to sinus and ear infections, pneumonia, and sepsis.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		To determine whether your symptoms are from a cold or from the flu, you need to see your doctor. Your doctor will run tests that can help determine what’s behind your symptoms.<br>
