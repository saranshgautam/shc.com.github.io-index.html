	<h1>Cold remedies for children</h1>
	<p>
		The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) doesn’t recommend children under the age of 4 take OTC cold medicines. Some doctors stretch that recommendation to age 6. If you have any questions, talk with your child’s doctor.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		Ease a child’s cold symptoms with these home remedies:
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Rest:</b> Children who have a cold may be more lethargic and irritable than normal. Let them stay home from school and rest until the cold has cleared.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Hydration:</b> It’s very important children with a cold get plenty of fluids. Colds can dehydrate them quickly. Make sure they’re drinking regularly. Water is great. Warm drinks like tea can pull double duty as a sore throat soother.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Food:</b> Kids with a cold may not feel as hungry as usual, so look for ways to give them calories and fluids. Smoothies and soups are two great options.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Salt gargles:</b> They aren’t the most pleasant experience, but gargling with warm, salty water can make sore throats feel better. Saline nasal sprays can also help clear nasal congestion.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Warm baths:</b> A warm bath can sometimes help reduce a fever and ease mild aches and pains that are common with a cold.<br>
