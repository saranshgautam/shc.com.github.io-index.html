	<p>

	</p>

		<li>avoiding contact with sick people</li><br>
	</ul>
	<p>
		If you’ve been in close contact with one or more people who have a bacterial meningococcal infection, your doctor can give you preventive antibiotics. This will decrease your chances of developing the disease.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		Vaccinations can also protect against certain types of meningitis. Vaccines that can prevent meningitis include the following:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) vaccine</li>
		<li>pneumococcal conjugate vaccine</li>
		<li><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/vaccinations/meningococcal">meningococcal vaccine</a></li><br>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Practicing good personal hygiene may also help you prevent meningitis. Some types of meningitis are spread through close contact with an infected person’s body fluid, such as saliva and nasal secretions. Avoid sharing drinks, utensils, and personal items that may carry saliva or other fluids. <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/meningitis-awareness/avoidance">Take these steps to prevent getting meningitis</a>.
