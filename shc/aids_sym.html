	<h1>Early symptoms of HIV</h1>
	<p>
		The first few weeks after someone contracts HIV is called the <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/acute-hiv-infection">acute infection stage</a>. During this time, the virus reproduces rapidly. The person’s immune system responds by producing HIV antibodies. These are proteins that fight infection.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		During this stage, some people have no symptoms at first. However, many people experience symptoms in the first month or two after contracting the virus, but often don’t realize they’re caused by HIV. This is because symptoms of the acute stage can be very similar to those of the flu or other seasonal viruses. They may be mild to severe, they may come and go, and they may last anywhere from a few days to several weeks.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		Early symptoms of HIV can include:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/hiv-aids/fevers-and-hiv">fever</a></li>
		<li>chills</li>
		<li><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/hiv-aids/swollen-lymph-nodes">swollen lymph nodes</a></li>
		<li>general aches and pains</li>
		<li>skin rashes</li>
		<li>sore throat</li>
		<li>headache</li>
		<li>nausea</li>
		<li>upset stomach</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Because these symptoms are similar to common illnesses like the flu, the person with them might not think they need to see a healthcare provider. And even if they do, their healthcare provider might suspect the <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/cold-flu/flu">flu</a> or <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/mononucleosis">mononucleosis</a> and might not even consider HIV.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		Whether a person has symptoms or not, during this period their <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/hiv-aids/your-hiv-viral-load">viral load</a> is very high. The viral load is the amount of HIV found in the bloodstream. A high viral load means that HIV can be easily transmitted to someone else during this time.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		Initial HIV symptoms usually resolve within a few months as the person enters the chronic, or clinical latency, stage of HIV. This stage can last many years or even decades with treatment.<br>
	</p>

	<h1>What are the symptoms of AIDS?</h1>
	<p>
		AIDS refers to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. With this condition, the immune system is weakened due to HIV that’s typically gone untreated for many years. If HIV is found and treated early with antiretroviral therapy, a person will usually not develop AIDS.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		People with HIV may develop AIDS if their HIV is not diagnosed until late, or if they know they have HIV but don’t consistently take their antiretroviral therapy. They may also develop AIDS if they have a type of HIV that’s resistant to (doesn’t respond to) the antiretroviral treatment.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		Without proper and consistent treatment, people living with HIV can develop AIDS sooner. By that time, the immune system is quite damaged and has a harder time fighting off infection and disease. With the use of antiretroviral therapy, a person can maintain chronic HIV infection without developing AIDS for decades.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		Symptoms of AIDS can include:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>recurrent fever</li>
		<li>chronic swollen lymph glands, espicially of armpits, neck and groin</li>
		<li>chronic fatigue</li>
		<li>night sweats</li>
		<li>dark splotches under the skin or inside the mouth, nose, or eyelids</li>
		<li>sores, spots, or lesions of the mouth and tongue, genitals, or anus</li>
		<li>bumps, lesions, or rashes of the skin</li>
		<li>recurrent or chronic diarrhea</li>
		<li>rapid weight loss</li>
		<li>neurologic problems such as trouble concentrating, memory loss, and confusion</li>
		<li>anxiety and depression</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Antiretroviral therapy controls the virus and usually prevents progression to AIDS. Other infections and complications of AIDS can also be treated. That treatment must be tailored to the individual needs of the person.
