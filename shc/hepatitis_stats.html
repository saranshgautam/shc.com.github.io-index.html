	<h1>Data and Statictics</h1>
	<p>
		Hepatitis B and C affect millions of people in the European Region. Worldwide, 500 million people are estimated to be infected with hepatitis B or C. These viruses kill <b>1.5 million people a year; 1 in every 3 people</b> has been exposed to either or both viruses and most infected people do not know about it due to dormant symptoms.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		Data that has recently become available, shows that in the WHO European Region an estimated <b>13.3 million</b> people live with chronic hepatitis B <b>(1.8% of adults)</b> and an estimated <b>15 million</b> people with hepatitis C <b>(2.0% of adults)</b>. <b>Two-thirds</b> of infected persons in the Region live in eastern Europe and central Asia. Hepatitis B causes about <b>36 000 deaths</b> and hepatitis C about <b>86 000 deaths per year in WHO European Member States</b>.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		The number of cases of hepatitis B and C reported in the WHO European Region does not necessarily reflect the full extent of transmission. A synthesis report on effective interventions to reduce hepatitis C infection from WHO/Europeâ€™s Health Evidence Network (HEN) estimates prevalence of up to <b>98% among</b> people who inject drugs.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) estimates:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>an overall hepatitis B incidence of <b>1.49 per 100 000</b></li>
		<li>a hepatitis C incidence of <b>8.7 per 100 000</b> in the Member States of the European Union (EU)</li>
		<li>high prevalence in people who inject drugs</li>
	</ul>
