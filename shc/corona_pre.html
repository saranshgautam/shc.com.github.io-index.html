		How can you prevent coronaviruses?
	</h1>
	<p>
		The best way to prevent the spread of infection is to avoid or limit contact with people who are showing symptoms of COVID-19 or any respiratory infection.<br>
		The next best thing you can do is practice good hygiene and physical distancing to prevent bacteria and viruses from spreading.

		<h2>Prevention tips</h1>
			<ul>
				<li>Wash your hands frequently for at least 20 seconds at a time with warm water and soap. How long is 20 seconds? About as long as it takes to sing your “ABCs.”</li>
				<li>Don’t touch your face, eyes, nose, or mouth when your hands are dirty.</li>
				<li>Don’t go out if you’re feeling sick or have any cold or flu symptoms.</li>
				<li>Stay at <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/social-distancing.html">least 6 feet</a> (2 meters) away from people.</li>
				<li>Cover your mouth with a tissue or the inside of your elbow whenever you sneeze or cough. Throw away any tissues you use right away.</li>
				<li>Clean any objects you touch a lot. Use disinfectants on objects like phones, computers, utensils, dishware, and doorknobs.</li>

	<h1>Should you wear a mask?</h1>
	<p>
		If you’re out in a public setting where it’s difficult to follow physical distancing guidelines, the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover.html">CDC</a> recommends that you wear a cloth face mask that covers your mouth and nose.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		When worn correctly, and by large percentages of the public, these masks can help to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		That’s because they can block the respiratory droplets of people who may be asymptomatic or people who have the virus but have gone undiagnosed. Respiratory droplets get into the air when you exhale, talk, cough, or sneeze.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		You can <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/the-best-material-for-a-homemade-face-mask">make your own mask</a> using basic materials such as a bandana, a T-shirt, or cotton fabric. The CDC provides <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html">instructions</a> for making one with scissors or with a sewing machine.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		Cloth masks are preferred for the general public, since <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/coronavirus-mask">other types of masks</a> should be reserved for healthcare workers.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		It’s critical to keep the mask clean. Wash it each time you use it. Avoid touching the front of it with your hands. Also, try to avoid touching your mouth, nose, and eyes when you remove it. This prevents you from possibly transferring the virus from a mask to your hands and from your hands to your face.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		Keep in mind that wearing a mask isn’t a replacement for other preventive measures, such as frequent handwashing and practicing physical distancing. All of them are important.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		Certain people shouldn’t wear face masks. They include children under 2 years old, people who have trouble breathing, and people who are unable to remove their own masks.
