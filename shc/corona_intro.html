	<h1>What is the 2019 coronavirus?</h1>
	<p>
		In early 2020, a new virus began generating headlines all over the world because of the unprecedented speed of its transmission.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		From its origins in a food market in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, to countries as far-flung as the United States and the Philippines, the virus (officially named SARS-CoV-2) has affected hundreds of thousands, with a rising global death toll now <a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html">over 182,000</a>.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		The disease caused by an infection with SARS-CoV-2 is called COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		In spite of the global panic in the news about this virus, you’re unlikely to contract SARS-CoV-2 unless you’ve been in contact with someone who has a SARS-CoV-2 infection.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		Let’s bust some myths. Read on to learn how this coronavirus is spread, how it’s similar and different from other coronaviruses, and how to prevent spreading it to others if you suspect you’ve contracted this virus.<br>

	<h1>What causes coronavirus?</h1>
	<p>
		Coronaviruses are zoonotic. This means they first develop in animals before developing in humans.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		For the virus to pass from animal to humans, a person has to come into close contact with an animal that carries the infection.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		Once the virus develops in people, coronaviruses can be spread from person to person through respiratory droplets. This is a technical name for the wet stuff that moves through the air when you cough or sneeze.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		The viral material hangs out in these droplets and can be breathed into the respiratory tract (your windpipe and lungs), where the virus can then lead to an infection.
	</p>
	<p>
		The 2019 coronavirus hasn’t been definitively linked to a specific animal.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		Researchers believe that the virus may have been passed from bats to another animal — either <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/coronavirus-can-be-deadly-but-they-also-cause-the-common-cold-what-to-know">snakes or pangolins</a> — and then transmitted to humans. This transmission likely occurred in the open food market in Wuhan, China.
