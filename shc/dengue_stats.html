	<h1>More about dengue</h1>
	<p>
		Dengue can exist anywhere that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aedes_aegypti"><i>Aedes aegypti</i></a> mosquitoes live. The most significant dengue epidemics in recent years have occurred in Southeast Asia, the Americas and the Western Pacific. Approximately 141 countries are affected.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		According to the World Health Organization, dengue fever is the most critical mosquito-borne disease in the world – it's also the most rapidly spreading. There has been a 30-fold increase in global incidence over the past 50 years.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		More than 40 per cent of the world’s population is at risk of dengue infection. <br>

Each year, an estimated 390 million dengue infections occur around the world. Of these, around 500,000 cases develop into severe dengue, or dengue haemorrhagic fever, a more severe form of the disease, which results in up to 25,000 deaths annually worldwide. That's each year.
