		Where did AIDS come from?
	</h1>
	<p>
		Scientists have traced the origin of HIV back to chimpanzees and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), an HIV-like virus that attacks the immune system of monkeys and apes.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		In 1999, researchers identified a strain of chimpanzee SIV called SIVcpz, which was nearly identical to HIV. Chimps, the scientist later discovered, hunt and eat two smaller species of monkeys—red-capped mangabeys and greater spot-nosed monkeys—that carry and infect the chimps with two strains of SIV. These two strains likely combined to form SIVcpz, which can spread between chimpanzees and humans.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		SIVcpz likely jumped to humans when hunters in Africa ate infected chimps, or the chimps’ infected blood got into the cuts or wounds of hunters. Researchers believe the first transmission of SIV to HIV in humans that then lead to the global pandemic occurred in 1920 in Kinshasa, the capital and largest city in the Democratic Republic of Congo.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		The virus spread may have spread from Kinshasa along infrastructure routes (roads, railways, and rivers) via migrants and the sex trade.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		In the 1960s, HIV spread from Africa to Haiti and the Caribbean when Haitian professionals in the colonial Democratic Republic of Congo returned home. The virus then moved from the Caribbean to <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/us-states/new-york-city">New York City</a> around 1970 and then to <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/san-francisco">San Francisco</a> later in the decade.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		International travel from the United States helped the virus spread across the rest of the globe.
