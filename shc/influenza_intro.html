	<h1>Overview</h1>
	<p>
		Influenza is a viral infection that attacks your respiratory system — your nose, throat and lungs. Influenza is commonly called the flu, but it's not the same as <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/cold-flu/best-remedies-stomach-flu">stomach flu</a> viruses that cause diarrhea and vomiting.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		For most people, influenza resolves on its own. But sometimes, influenza and its complications can be deadly. People at higher risk of developing flu complications include:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Young children under age 5, and especially those under 12 months</li>
		<li>Adults older than age 65</li>
		<li>Residents of nursing homes and other long-term care facilities</li>
		<li>Pregnant women and women up to two weeks postpartum</li>
		<li>People with weakened immune systems</li>
		<li>People who have chronic illnesses, such as asthma, heart disease, kidney disease, liver disease and diabetes</li>
		<li>People who are very obese, with a body mass index (BMI) of 40 or higher</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Though the annual influenza vaccine isn't 100 percent effective, it's still your best defense against the flu.<br>
	</p>

		What’s the difference between a cold and the flu?
	</h1>
	<p>
		The common cold and the flu may seem similar at first. They’re both respiratory illnesses and can cause similar symptoms. But different viruses cause these two conditions. Your symptoms help you tell the difference between them.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		Both a cold and the flu share a few common symptoms. People with either illness often experience:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>runny or stuffy nose</li>
		<li>sneezing</li>
		<li>body aches</li>
		<li>general fatigue</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		As a rule, flu symptoms are more severe than cold symptoms.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		Another distinct difference between the two is how serious they are. Colds rarely cause other health conditions or problems. But the flu can lead to <a href="https://www.healthline.com/symptom/sinusitis">sinus</a> and <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/ear-infections">ear infections</a>, <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/pneumonia">pneumonia</a>, and <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/sepsis">sepsis</a>.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		To determine whether your symptoms are from a cold or from the flu, you need to see your doctor. Your doctor will run tests that can help determine what’s behind your symptoms.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		If your doctor diagnoses a cold, you’ll only need to treat your symptoms until the virus has run its course. These treatments can include using <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/common-cold-drugs"> over-the-counter (OTC) cold medications</a>, staying hydrated, and getting plenty of rest.
	</p>
	<p>
		Taking flu medicine early in the virus’ cycle may help reduce severity of illness and shorten the time that you are sick. Rest and hydration are also beneficial for people with the flu. Much like the common cold, the flu just needs time to work its way through your body.<br>
