	<h1>History of Malaria</h1>
	<p>
		The history of malaria stretches from its prehistoric origin as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoonotic">zoonotic</a> disease in the primates of Africa through to the 21st century. A widespread and potentially lethal human infectious disease, at its peak malaria infested every continent, except<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctica">Antarctica</a>. Its prevention and treatment have been targeted in science and medicine for hundreds of years. Since the discovery of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasite">parasites</a> which cause it, research attention has focused on their biology, as well as that of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquitoe">mosquitoes</a> which transmit the parasites.<br>

	<p>
		References to its unique, periodic fevers are found throughout recorded history beginning in the first millennium BC in Greece and China.<br>

		For thousands of years, traditional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbalism">herbal remedies</a> have been used to treat malaria. The first effective treatment for malaria came from the bark of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinchona">cinchona tree</a>, which contains <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinine">quinine</a>. After the link to mosquitos and their parasites were identified in the early twentieth century, mosquito control measures such as widespread use of the insecticide <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane">DDT</a>, swamp drainage, covering or oiling the surface of open water sources, indoor residual spraying and use of insecticide treated nets was initiated. Prophylactic quinine was prescribed in malaria endemic areas, and new therapeutic drugs, including chloroquine and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemisinin">artemisinins</a>, were used to resist the scourge. Today, artemisinin is present in every remedy applied in treatment of malaria. After introducing artemisinin as a cure administered together with other remedies, the mortality in Africa went down by a half.

		Malaria was the most important health hazard encountered by U.S. troops in the South Pacific during <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II">World War II</a>, where about 500,000 men were infected. According to Joseph Patrick Byrne, "Sixty thousand American soldiers died of malaria during the African and South Pacific campaigns.
