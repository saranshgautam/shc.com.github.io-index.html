	<h1>What is chickenpox?</h1>
	<p>
		Chickenpox, also called varicella, is characterized by itchy red blisters that appear all over the body. A virus causes this condition. It often affects children, and was so common it was considered a childhood rite of passage.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		It’s very rare to have the chickenpox infection more than once. And since the chickenpox vaccine was introduced in the mid-1990s, cases have declined.
	</p>
	<h1>Who is at risk of developing the chicken pox?</h1>
	<p>
		Exposure to the virus through previous active infection or vaccination reduces risk. Immunity from the virus can be passed on from a mother to her newborn. Immunity lasts about three months from birth.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		Anyone who has not been exposed may contract the virus. Risk increases under any of these conditions:<br>
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>You have had recent contact with an infected person.</li>
		<li>You are under 12 years of age.</li>
		<li>You are an adult living with children.</li>
		<li>You have spent time in a school or child care facility.
</li>
		<li>Your immune system is compromised due to illness or medications.
</li>
	</ul>
	<h1>How is chickenpox diagnosed?</h1>
	<p>
		You should always call your doctor any time you develop an unexplained rash, especially if it’s accompanied by <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/common-cold-symptoms">cold symptoms</a> or fever. One of several viruses or infections could be affecting you. Tell your doctor right away if you are pregnant and have been <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/pregnancy/infections-varicella-zoster">exposed to chickenpox</a>.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		You doctor may be able to diagnose chickenpox based on a physical exam of blisters on you or your child’s body. Or, lab tests can confirm the cause of the blisters.
