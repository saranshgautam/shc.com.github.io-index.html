	<h1>What are the symptoms?</h1>
	<p>
		Doctors are learning new things about this virus every day. So far, we know that COVID-19 may not initially cause any symptoms for some people.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		You may carry the virus for <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/symptoms.html">2 days or up to 2 weeks</a> before you notice symptoms.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		Some <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/coronavirus-symptoms">common symptoms</a> that have been specifically linked to COVID-19 include:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/breathing-difficulties">shortness of breath</a></li>
		<li>having a <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/types-of-coughs">cough</a> that gets more severe over time</li>
		<li>a low-grade <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/fever">fever</a> that gradually increases in temperature</li><br>
	</ul>
	<p>
		These symptoms may become more severe in some people. Call emergency medical services if you or someone you care for have any of the following symptoms:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>trouble breathing</li>
		<li>blue lips or face</li>
		<li>persistent pain or pressure in the chest</li>
