		What are the symptoms of the flu?
	</h1>
	<p>
		Here are some of the common symptoms of the flu.<br>
	</p>
	<h2>Fever</h2>
	<p>
		The flu almost always causes an increase in your <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/what-is-normal-body-temperature">body temperature</a>. This is also known as a fever. Most flu-related fevers range from a low-grade fever around 100°F (37.8°C) to as high as 104°F (40°C).<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		Although alarming, it’s not uncommon for young children to have higher fevers than adults. If you suspect your child has the flu, see your doctor.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		You may feel “feverish” when you have an elevated temperature. Symptoms include <a href="https://www.healthline.com/symptom/chills">chills</a>, sweats, or being cold despite your body’s high temperature. Most fevers last for less than one week, usually around three to four days.<br>
	</p>
	<h2>Cough</h2>
	<p>
		A dry, persistent cough is common with the flu. The cough may worsen, becoming uncomfortable and painful. You may also experience shortness of breath or chest discomfort during this time. Many flu-related coughs can last for about two weeks.<br>
	</p>
	<h2>Muscle aches</h2>
	<p>
		These flu-related muscle pains are most common in your neck, back, arms, and legs. They can often be severe, making it difficult to move even when trying to perform basic tasks.<br>
	</p>
	<h2>Headache</h2>
	<p>
		Your first symptom of the flu may be a severe headache. Sometimes eye symptoms, including light and sound sensitivity, go along with your headache.<br>
	</p>
	<h2>Fatigue</h2>
	<p>
		Feeling tired is a not-so-obvious symptom of the flu. Feeling generally unwell can be a sign of many conditions. These feelings of tiredness and fatigue may come on fast and be difficult to overcome.<br>
