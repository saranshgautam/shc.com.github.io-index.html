	<h1>Cholera</h1>
	<p>
		Cholera is a serious bacterial disease that usually causes severe diarrhea and dehydration. The disease is typically spread through contaminated water. In severe cases, immediate treatment is necessary because death can occur within hours. This can happen even if you were healthy before you caught it.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		Modern sewage and water treatment have effectively eliminated cholera in most countries. It’s still a problem in countries in Asia, Latin America, Africa, India, and the Middle East. Countries affected by war, poverty, and natural disasters have the greatest risk for a cholera outbreak. That’s because these conditions tend to force people to live in crowded areas without proper sanitation.<br>
	</p>
	<h1>Are You at Risk?</h1>
	<p>
		Anyone can become sick with cholera, but a few factors may increase your risk. These risk factors also increase the likelihood that you’ll have a severe case. These include:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>unclean conditions (such as poor sanitation and contaminated water)</li>
		<li>low levels of stomach acid (cholera bacteria cannot live in highly acidic environments)</li>
		<li>sick household members</li>
		<li>type O blood (it’s not clear why this is true, but more people with this blood type seem to be at risk for cholera)</li>
		<li>eating raw shellfish (if the shellfish live in dirty waters where the cholera bacteria live, there is greater chance of becoming ill)</li>
	</ul>
	<h1>Causes of Cholera</h1>
	<p>
		Cholera is caused by bacteria called Vibrio cholerae. The disease’s deadly effects are the result of a strong toxin known as CTX that is produced by these bacteria in your small intestine. CTX interferes with the normal flow of sodium and chloride when it binds to your intestinal walls. When the bacteria attaches to the small intestine’s walls, your body begins to secrete large amounts of water that lead to diarrhea and rapid loss of fluids and salts.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		Contaminated water supplies are the primary source of cholera infection. Uncooked fruits, vegetables, and other foods can also contain the bacteria that cause cholera.
		<br>
Cholera is not usually passed from person to person through casual contact.
