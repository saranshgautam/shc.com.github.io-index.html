	<h1>History of Cholera</h1>
	<p>
		Though cholera has been around for many centuries, the disease came to prominence in the 19th century, when a lethal outbreak occurred in India. There have since been numerous outbreaks and seven global pandemics of cholera. Each year, cholera infects 1.3 to 4 million people around the world, killing 21,000 to 143,000 people, according to the <a href="https://www.who.int/">World Health Organization</a> (WHO).

	<h1>How Scientists Studied Cholera </h1>
	<p>
		Between 1852 and 1923, the world would see four more cholera pandemics.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		The third pandemic, stretching 1852–1859, was the deadliest. It devastated Asia, Europe, North America and Africa, killing 23,000 people in Great Britain alone in 1854, the worst single year of cholera.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		In that year, British physician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Snow">John Snow</a>, who’s considered one of the fathers of modern epidemiology, carefully mapped cholera cases in the Soho area of London, allowing him to identify the source of the disease in the area: Contaminated water from a public well pump.
