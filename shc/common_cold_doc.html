				Dr Shalini is trained in the department of Family Medicine, the broadest speciality in medicine, which forms the first line of defense for the patient. Her view of patient care is oriented to the patient rather than the disease, and her concern is the continuing welfare of the patient in the full context of his life situation rather than the episodic care of a presenting complaint. As rightly described in the words of Harvey Cushing “A physician is obligated to consider more than a diseased organ, more even than the whole man - they must view the man in his world”. She is exactly the personal physician, oriented to the whole patient. She has extensive experience and expertise in treating infectious diseases such as fever, flu, asthma, HIV, Hepatitis-B and STD’s as well as lifestyle disorders such as diabetes, hypertension and obesity. She uses evidence as a tool, not as a determinant of practice, listens to you, let people participate actively in all decisions related to their health and health care and gives unbiased advice. She shares the traits of an exceptional physician – Compassion, Professionalism, Humanity, Honesty and a Strong work ethic and she believes not in medicating the patient, but in educating and inspiring hope for her patients.
