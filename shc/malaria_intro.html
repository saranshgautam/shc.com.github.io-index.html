	<h1>What is malaria?</h1>
	<p>
		Malaria is a life-threatening disease. Itâ€™s typically transmitted through the bite of an infected <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anopheles">Anopheles mosquito</a>. Infected mosquitoes carry the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium">Plasmodium parasite</a>. When this mosquito bites you, the parasite is released into your bloodstream.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		Once the parasites are inside your body, they travel to the <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/liver-pain">liver</a>, where they mature. After several days, the mature parasites enter the bloodstream and begin to infect <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/rbc-count">red blood cells</a>.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		Within 48 to 72 hours, the parasites inside the red blood cells multiply, causing the infected cells to burst open.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		The parasites continue to infect red blood cells, resulting in symptoms that occur in cycles that last two to three days at a time.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		Malaria is typically found in tropical and subtropical climates where the parasites can live. The <a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs094/en/">World Health Organization (WHO)</a> states that, in 2016, there were an estimated 216 million cases of malaria in 91 countries.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/malaria/about/index.html">1,700 cases</a> of malaria annually. Most cases of malaria develop in people who <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/why-some-countries-can-get-rid-of-malaria">travel to countries</a> where malaria is more common.<br>
