	<h1>Dengue: The beginning of the end</h1>
	<p>
		Dengue viruses have been on the march for more than 100 years. Dengue originated in monkeys and spilled over into humans as long as 800 years ago. It was restricted to Africa and Southeast Asia until the mid-20th century. The dengue viruses in viremic individuals and their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aedes_aegypti"><i>Aedes aegypti</i></a> mosquito vectors spread throughout tropical Southeast Asia via maritime shipments.<br>

		The clinical picture of “breakbone fever” became more serious in the 1960s as cases of severe dengue (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=6627">dengue hemorrhagic fever; DHF</a>) and dengue shock syndrome occurred during epidemics in Southeast Asia. According to WHO, about 2.5 billion people — 40% of the world’s population — currently live in areas where there is a risk of dengue transmission. Dengue is endemic in at least 100 countries in Asia, the Pacific, the Americas, the Caribbean and Africa, with estimates that 50 to 100 million infections occur yearly, resulting in 500,000 DHF cases and 22,000 deaths, mostly among children. These numbers underestimate the global burden of dengue, because many infections are asymptomatic (but can serve as infectious blood meals for mosquitoes) or may be misdiagnosed as febrile diseases of other etiologies such as <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chikungunya">chikungunya</a>, <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/zika-virus">Zika virus</a> or <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/about/faqs.html">malaria.
