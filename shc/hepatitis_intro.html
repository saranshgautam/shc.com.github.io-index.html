	<h1>What is hepatitis?</h1>
	<p>
		Hepatitis refers to an inflammatory condition of the liver. It’s commonly caused by a viral infection, but there are other possible causes of hepatitis. These include autoimmune hepatitis and hepatitis that occurs as a secondary result of medications, drugs, toxins, and alcohol. <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/autoimmune-hepatitis">Autoimmune hepatitis</a> is a disease that occurs when your body makes antibodies against your liver tissue.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		Your <a href="https://www.healthline.com/human-body-maps/liver">liver</a> is located in the right upper area of your abdomen. It performs many critical functions that affect metabolism throughout your body, including:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>bile production, which is essential to <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/digestive-health">digestion</a></li>
		<li>filtering of toxins from your body</li>
		<li>excretion of bilirubin (a product of broken-down red blood cells), cholesterol, hormones, and drugs</li>
		<li>breakdown of <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/food-nutrition/simple-carbohydrates-complex-carbohydrates">carbohydrates</a>, fats, and proteins</li>
		<li>activation of enzymes, which are specialized proteins essential to body functions</li>
		<li>storage of glycogen (a form of sugar), minerals, and vitamins (A, D, E, and K)</li>
		<li>synthesis of blood proteins, such as albumin</li>
		<li>synthesis of clotting factors</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		According to the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/stltpublichealth/didyouknow/topic/hepatitis.html">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a>, approximately 4.4 million Americans are currently living with chronic hepatitis B and C. Many more people don’t even know that they have hepatitis.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		Treatment options vary depending on which type of hepatitis you have. You can prevent some forms of hepatitis through immunizations and lifestyle precautions.<br>

	<h1>
		The 5 types of viral hepatitis
	</h1>
	<p>
		Viral infections of the liver that are classified as hepatitis include hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E. A different virus is responsible for each type of virally transmitted hepatitis.<br>

Hepatitis A is always an acute, short-term disease, while hepatitis B, C, and D are most likely to become ongoing and chronic. Hepatitis E is usually acute but can be particularly dangerous in pregnant women.
	<br></p>
	<h2>Hepatitis A</h2>
	<p>
		<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/hepatitis-a">Hepatitis A</a> is caused by an infection with the hepatitis A virus (HAV). This type of hepatitis is most commonly transmitted by consuming food or water contaminated by feces from a person infected with hepatitis A.<br>
	</p>
	<h2>Hepatitis B</h2>
	<p>
		<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/hepatitis-b">Hepatitis B</a> is transmitted through contact with infectious body fluids, such as blood, vaginal secretions, or semen, containing the hepatitis B virus (HBV). Injection drug use, having sex with an infected partner, or sharing razors with an infected person increase your risk of getting hepatitis B.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		It’s estimated by the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/hbv/pdfs/hepbatrisk.pdf">CDC</a> that 1.2 million people in the United States and 350 million people worldwide live with this chronic disease.<br>
	</p>
	<h2>Hepatitis C</h2>
	<p>
		<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/hepatitis-c">Hepatitis C</a> comes from the hepatitis C virus (HCV). Hepatitis C is transmitted through direct contact with infected body fluids, typically through injection drug use and sexual contact. HCV is among the most common bloodborne viral infections in the United States. <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/hcv/cfaq.htm#statistics">Approximately 2.7 to 3.9 million Americans</a> are currently living with a chronic form of this infection.<br>
	</p>
	<h2>Hepatitis D</h2>
	<p>
		Also called delta hepatitis, <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/delta-agent-hepatitis-d">hepatitis D</a> is a serious liver disease caused by the hepatitis D virus (HDV). HDV is contracted through direct contact with infected blood. Hepatitis D is a rare form of hepatitis that only occurs in conjunction with hepatitis B infection. The hepatitis D virus can’t multiply without the presence of hepatitis B. It’s very uncommon in the United States.<br>
	</p>
	<h2>Hepatitis E</h2>
	<p>
		<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/hepatitis-e">Hepatitis E</a> is a waterborne disease caused by the hepatitis E virus (HEV). Hepatitis E is mainly found in areas with poor sanitation and typically results from ingesting fecal matter that contaminates the water supply. This disease is uncommon in the United States. However, cases of hepatitis E have been reported in the Middle East, Asia, Central America, and Africa, according to the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/HEV/HEVfaq.htm#section1">CDC</a>.
