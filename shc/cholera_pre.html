	<h1>Preventing Cholera Infection</h1>
	<p>
		If you’re traveling to an area where cholera is common, your chances of catching the disease are still low if you:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Wash your hands with soap and clean water every time you use the bathroom, and before you eat or prepare food. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand cleaner that is at least 60% alcohol.</li>
		<li>drink only bottled or boiled water</li>
		<li>If bottled water is not available, you can disinfect water by boiling it for one minute or filtering it, and then adding two drops of household bleach or half of an iodine tablet per liter of water.</li>
		<li>Eat foods that are pre-packaged or that are freshly cooked and served hot. Avoid raw and undercooked meats and seafood or unpeeled fruits and vegetables.</li>
		<li>avoid dairy foods</li>
		<li>eat raw fruits and vegetables that you can peel yourself</li>
		<li>Dispose of feces in a place away from water that is used for drinking or food, especially if you have had cholera.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Since cholera vaccines don’t work very well and most people have a slim chance of catching cholera, your doctor is not likely to provide you with a vaccination. If you’ve already had the vaccine and are going to be in a country where cholera is a threat, you may need a second dose or booster of the vaccine.
