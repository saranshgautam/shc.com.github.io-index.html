	<h1>Cold prevention</h1>
	<p>
		Colds are very minor, but they are inconvenient and can certainly be miserable. You can’t get a vaccine to prevent colds like you can the flu. But you can do a few key things during cold season to help you avoid picking up one of the viruses.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		Here are four tips for cold prevention:
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Wash your hands.</b> Old-fashioned soap and water is the best way to stop the spread of germs. Only use antibacterial gels and sprays as a last resort when you can’t get to a sink.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Take care of your gut.</b> Eat plenty of bacteria-rich foods like yogurt, or take a daily probiotic supplement. Keeping your gut bacteria community healthy can help your overall health.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Avoid sick people.</b> This is reason number one sick people shouldn’t come into work or school. It’s very easy to share germs in tight quarters like offices or classrooms. If you notice someone isn’t feeling well, go out of your way to avoid them. Be sure to wash your hands after coming into contact them.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Cover your cough.</b> Likewise, if you’re feeling sick, don’t keep infecting people around you. Cover your cough with a tissue or cough and sneeze into your elbow so you don’t spray germs into your environment.<br>
