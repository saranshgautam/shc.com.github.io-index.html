	<h1>Symptoms of Cholera</h1>
	<p>
		The majority of people exposed to cholera never become ill. In fact, in most cases, you may never know you’ve been exposed. Once you’re infected, you’ll continue to shed cholera bacteria in your stools for seven to 14 days. Cholera usually causes mild to moderate diarrhea, like other illnesses.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		One in 10 people who are infected will develop typical symptoms within two to three days after infection.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		Common symptoms of cholera include:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>sudden onset of diarrhea</li>
		<li><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea/symptoms.htm">nausea</a></li>
		<li>vomiting</li>
		<li>mild to severe <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dehydration/symptoms-causes/syc-20354086">dehydration</a></li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		The dehydration caused by cholera is usually severe and can cause tiredness, moodiness, sunken eyes, dry mouth, shriveled skin, extreme thirst, reduced urine output, irregular heartbeat, and low blood pressure.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		Dehydration may lead to loss of minerals in your blood. This can lead to an electrolyte imbalance. The first sign of an electrolyte imbalance is severe muscle cramps. An electrolyte imbalance can eventually lead to shock.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		Children usually have the same cholera symptoms as adults. Children may also experience the following:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>severe drowsiness</li>
		<li>fever</li>
		<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convulsion">convulsions</a></li>
		<li>coma</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Cholera rarely occurs in first world nations. If you follow proper food safety practices, even in affected areas, the risk of infection is minor. Still, cholera continues to occur worldwide. If you develop severe diarrhea after visiting an area with a high rate of cholera, you should see a doctor.
