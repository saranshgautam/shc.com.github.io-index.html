	<h1>How can chickenpox be prevented?</h1>
	<p>
		The chickenpox vaccine prevents chickenpox in <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chickenpox/basics/prevention/con-20019025">98 percent</a> of people who receive the two recommended doses. Your child should get the shot when they are between 12 and 15 months of age. Children get a booster between 4 and 6 years of age.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		Older children and adults who haven’t been vaccinated or exposed may receive catch-up doses of the vaccine. As chickenpox tends to be more severe in older adults, people who haven’t been vaccinated may opt to get the shots later.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		People unable to receive the vaccine can try to avoid the virus by limiting contact with infected people. But this can be difficult. Chickenpox can’t be identified by its blisters until it has already been spreadable to others for days.
