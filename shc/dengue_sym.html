	<h1>Symptoms</h1>
	<p>
		Many people, especially children and teens, may experience no signs or symptoms during a mild case of dengue fever. When symptoms do occur, they usually begin four to seven days after you are bitten by an infected mosquito.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		Dengue fever causes a high fever — 104 F degrees — and at least two of the following symptoms:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Headache</li>
		<li>Muscle, bone and joint pain</li>
		<li><a href="https://www.everydayhealth.com/nausea/guide/">Nausea</a></li>
		<li>Vomiting</li>
		<li>Pain behind eyes</li>
		<li><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/swollen-lymph-nodes">Swollen glands</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/rashes">Rash</a></li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Most people recover within a week or so. In some cases, symptoms worsen and can become life-threatening. Blood vessels often become damaged and leaky. And the number of clot-forming cells (platelets) in your bloodstream drops. This can cause a severe form of dengue fever, called dengue hemorrhagic fever, severe dengue or dengue shock syndrome.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		Signs and symptoms of dengue hemorrhagic fever or severe dengue — a life-threatening emergency — include:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Severe abdominal pain</li>
		<li>Persistent vomiting</li>
		<li>Bleeding from your gums or nose</li>
		<li>Blood in your urine, stools or vomit</li>
		<li>Bleeding under the skin, which might look like bruising</li>
		<li>Difficult or rapid breathing</li>
		<li>Cold or <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/322446">clammy skin</a> (shock)</li>
		<li><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/fatigue">Fatigue</a></li>
		<li>Irritability or restlessness</li>
