	<h1>Prevalence</h1>
	<p>
		The flu has resulted in <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html">9.3 million to 49 million illnesses</a> each year in the United States since 2010. Each year, on average, <a href="https://www.cdcfoundation.org/businesspulse/flu-prevention-infographic">five to 20 percent</a> of the United States population gets the flu.
	</p>
	<p>
		It is estimated that the flu results in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4521706/">31.4 million</a> outpatient visits and more than <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4521706/">200,000 hospitalizations</a> each year.
	</p>
	<p>
		During the severe <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/spotlights/press-conference-2018-19.htm">2017-2018 flu season</a>, one of the longest in recent years, estimates indicate that more than 900,000 people were hospitalized and more than 80,000 people died from flu.
	</p>
	<p>
		Additionally, as of late October 2018, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/season/flu-season-2017-2018.htm">185 pediatric</a> deaths had been reported to CDC during the 2017-2018 season. Approximately 80 percent of these deaths occurred in children who had not received a flu vaccination.
	</p>
	<p>
		Last season took the greatest toll on adults age 65 years and older. About <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/season/flu-season-2017-2018.htm">58 percent</a> of the estimated hospitalizations occurred in that age group.
	</p>
	<h1>Costs</h1>
	<p>
		The flu <a href="https://www.cdcfoundation.org/businesspulse/flu-prevention-infographic)">costs an estimated $10.4 billion a year in direct medical expenses and another $16.3 billion in lost earnings annually.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		Additionally, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/flu/activities.html">the flu</a> causes United States employees to miss approximately 17 million workdays due to flu, which costs an estimated $7 billion a year in sick days and lost productivity.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		One <a href="https://www.challengergray.com/press/press-releases/update-2-flu-season-cost-employers-21b">report</a> put the estimate of the cost of lost productivity to employers due to the flu in 2017-2018 at more than $21 billion, according to employment consulting firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Moreover, an estimated 25 million workers got sick, while $855.68 was the average amount of wages lost due to missing shifts.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		A <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29801998">2018 report</a> estimated the average annual total economic burden of seasonal influenza to the American healthcare system and society was $11.2 billion. Direct medical costs were estimated to be $3.2 billion and indirect costs $8 billion.
